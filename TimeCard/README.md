# Time Card

## Purpose
Time Card allows users to quickly (at the press of a button from the app, widget, or notification) clock in and out of projects in order to record time spent on an activity.

By exporting this data, the user is then able to use a third party program (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets) to analyze the data.
 
Examples:
* Record your time spent working out by clocking in and out at the start and end or your workouts
